**Books:** The course materials include a variety of links to online sources. Additionally if you are a "book person" you may be interested in the books, @kochenderfer2019algorithms, @lauwens2019think, @nazarathy2021statistics, and @tureci2025julia. The _Kochenderfer and Wheeler_ book is a great optimization resource using Julia code. The _Lauwens and Downey_ is a great introductory coding book using Julia, The _Nazarathy and Klok_ book is a statistics book, also introducing Julia. Finally, the newer _Türeci, Dağıstanlı, and Türk Çakır_ seems to be a good resource, especially for readers with a physics background.
